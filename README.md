This repository contains the code and supplementary files for the MSc dissertation:
"Forecasting PM2.5 in Johannesburg Using LSTM: Building on Peer-Reviewed Models for Air Quality in the Global South."

## Overview
The project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast PM2.5 concentrations in Johannesburg. It builds upon the methodology and code from Masinde et al., 2024 (Nairobi dataset).
